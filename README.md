# Cmacc-Vendor
The /vendor/ folder of a Cmacc (ProseObject) website - has all the code except "include.php" which is in the root

To make a Cmacc (ProseObject) website:

# Make a root folder in a web-enabled, PHP and Perl place.

# Copy "include.php" into the root folder. (You'll find a copy loitering in the folder /png/ in this repo (useless there, but convenient for copying.)

# Mount this repo as vendor/ 

# Make a new folder Doc/ in the root - that is where your ProseObjects live.  You will very likely have to populate it with the Cmacc-Z folder which has all the document widgets (mount as Doc/Z/), perhaps Cmacc-U with demo objects for persons and places (Doc/U/), and other substantive ones with documents you are interested in.

# If you want all of the current commonaccord.org website and documents, then you can clone Cmacc-Org instead of the above.
